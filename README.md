# advent-of-code
my advent of code repo
I'll post the programs I wrote for the advent of code 2020 here.
No guarantees whatsoever

I run the code on cpp.sh

It is not possible to open a file there(as far as i know).

therefore i format my input with notepad++ to something i think is usefull.

this is usally a 2 or 3d array.
